## Overview
Adding Auth0 to our front-end React app

## Getting Started


## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->

### Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?
Monday - Thurs 6:30 PM - 9:30 PM, Saturday 9 - 6 PM in Remo, for after hours communication we will use Slack

- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
Slack, Trello, Remo, GitHub

- How often will you take breaks?
We will take breaks every hour

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
We will be available 6:30 - 9:30 PM on Friday

### Cooperative

- Make a list of each person’s strengths.
Daniel: communication, team-work, I can lead or follow, depending on the needs of the team.
Louis: Able to work under pressure very well, detail-oriented.

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
If anything, it shows we compliment each other well, one persons weakness is potentially the other team members strength.

- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
Daniel: Code recognition, and coding.
Louis: Become a better coder, and simplify code for myself.

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
Effectively utilize driver and navigator, and make sure we're alternating consitently. Before each lab we'll hold a stand-up on the code we've previously worked on. This will ensure we are both caught up on what has been done and what we need to do.

### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
If we are utilizing driver / navigator roles, this will prevent this from happening.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
Driver / Navigator roles and daily stand-ups.

- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
Driver / Navigator roles and daily stand-ups.
